The folder structure of this project is:

- FYP (Parent Folder)
	- code
		- backend
		- frontend
		- MachineLearning
		- portfolio_optimization
	- data
		- models
		- normalizers
		- sentiment data


You don't have to run any of the codes to visualize our results.
The frontend and the backend have been deployed online to cloud servers.

The link to the frontend is:
https://stock-price-prediction.netlify.app/

The frontend sends API requests to the API hosted in backend:
https://fyp-backend-sai.herokuapp.com/predict

All the model training has been done in the file "code/MachineLearning/model_training/ML Process.ipynb"

The file "code/backend/batch_file.py" is developed by my groupmate to get historical sentiment of the past 7 days.
So, this file needs to be run everyday in the morning, and deployed it to Heroku.
(PS: I am running this file everyday).
